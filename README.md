# leaflet-challenge
In this assignment we are required to  create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

Your data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by colour. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in colour.


Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked and to create a legend that will provide context for your map data.

Your visualisation should look something like the preceding map.
